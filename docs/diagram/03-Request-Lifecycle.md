## Gaps to confirm

- Is the Customer told when a Request is cancelled? Not decided.
- State name "Reported" is a working label; CONTEXT.md only says "not yet accepted as work".
- Sign-up is closed (ADR 0003), so how a stranger gets an account in order to submit a Request has to be designed with this release.
